# ☕ Java with DSA  

This repo is my **Data Structures & Algorithms dojo** built with Java ⚔️.  
Here I sharpen my problem-solving skills with arrays, recursion, trees, graphs, and all the fun stuff.  

## 📂 Topics Covered  

| File/Section         | 🔍 What’s inside |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Arrays & Strings     | Searching, sorting, 2D arrays tricks |
| Recursion            | Solving problems by breaking them down 🔄 |
| Linked Lists         | Singly, doubly & circular linked lists |
| Stacks & Queues      | Push, Pop, Enqueue, Dequeue — all that jazz 📚 |
| Trees & Graphs       | Traversals, shortest paths, and graph algorithms |
| Dynamic Programming  | Optimized solutions to hard problems 💡 |

## 🧑‍💻 Skills I’m Building  

- ✅ Java fundamentals mastered  
- ✅ DSA foundations (arrays, recursion, linked lists)  
- ✅ Time & Space complexity analysis ⏳  
- ✅ Problem-solving mindset for coding interviews
